echo "📋 What's New:\n";
echo "   • Vessels can now be configured for 2 or 3 main engines\n";
echo "   • New engine configuration: Port, Center Main, Starboard\n";
echo "   • All data entry forms now support center main engine\n";
echo "   • Viewing and graphing works with all three engines\n\n";

echo "🔧 Next Steps:\n";
echo "   1. Go to Manage Vessels to set up three-engine vessels\n";
echo "   2. Existing vessels remain as standard (Port/Starboard)\n";
echo "   3. New vessels can be created with three-engine configuration\n\n";
